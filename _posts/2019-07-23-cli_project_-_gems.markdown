Ok, so when I say gems I don’t mean Ruby gems. I am referring to all the personal gems that I collected during the creation of this project. Through the project not only did I learn and understand how to code better but more importantly I learned how to put myself first, which translated to more energy and a clearer mind. The result was better code! Having said that, lets get to the gems! 

Depriving your self of sleep may be the first thing that you will be giving up in order to get more time code. You may open more time with this strategy, however the side effects of lack of sleep will counteract the extra time you have opened. Lack of sleep makes you extremely tired and hurts our cognitive processes in many ways (definitively the worst when coding!). By now you must know what the first gem is, that is correct you need to get your rest! You may not have that extra time but the time you do have will be at your full cognitive state and that equals to better code! 

Having a full-time job and other commitments can be very difficult. Many times you will feel overwhelmed and wanting to quit, always the easiest route. We all have the same amount of time available to us but only some of us treat every minute equally. The solution to this problem is the second gem - time management. Once you start scheduling your days the night before and open a slot to code the same time every day, this problem will drastically improve. There will be unforeseen events that may interrupt your time slot, however you will still be better off than having a scattered day. So schedule your calendar and be prepared to discover your new organized efficient self!   

Throughout your coding career you will have to watch an insane amount of instructional videos and tutorials. You will start to doubt your skill and potential when you watch these fantastic programmers easily solve problems, that you have been stuck on for hours with in a couple of minutes. You need to keep in mind that these programmers have numerous years of experience compared to your month or minimal expertise! The final gem is do not compare yourself to these professional programmers. This comparison can be detrimental to your coding career when you haven’t even really started. So just keep in mind that those programmers creating instructional and tutorial videos have been at it for many years. If you’re able to stay level headed and adopt this gem, one day we will all be watching your vidoes! 
With the help of all 3 gems and my instructor I was able to complete my CLI project. When it came to the technical aspect of my project, I had most issues with repeating myself in my code. Programmatic structuring isn’t as transparent to me at the moment but I know that with time I will look back and wonder why in the world was I doing that! Until that day I will continue to grind and put in the time necessary to evolve into the programmer I know I will one day become. 

Well I am just getting started and I am sure to run into a couple more new gems through out my coding career. Can’t wait to share any new findings!
